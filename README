--------------------------------- THE TESTS ARE FAILING -----------------------------------------
Something's broken, the tests aren't doing what they're supposed to do, run "Java VPL exercise1a 50"
to see for yourself, our work isn't done yet, I'll try to take a look and figure what's wrong this 
weekend. We could definetely turn this in as a 'serious first effort' though.

Currently working on Project 1; "Implement VPL by starting from the given file VPL.java. . .".
-------------------------------- DUE Monday, September 10 --------------------------------------
If you do anything make sure to add your name to the comment at the top of VPL.java
To launch from terminal, use "java VPL someUnitTests 200"
