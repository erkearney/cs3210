-----------Loops are broken, the labelLocations hashmap is never being populated with anything.-----------

ip - Instruction Pointer: Points to the next instruction for VPL to execute, default = 0.

bp - Base Pointer: Points to the beginning of the program's memory, default = number of instructions (k).

bpOffset - Base Pointer Offset: If the programmer references cell 5, VPL should access the 5th cell in the
stack frame. The stack frame begins two cells after the base pointer. So cell 5 = mem[bp+2 + 5]. bpOffset 
is just bp+2. Remember that every time we update the base pointer, we need to update bpOffset as well.

sp - Stack Pointer: Points to the END of the stack frame, default = bp+2.

rv - Return Value: Holds the value a function returned, default = -1.

hp - Heap Pointer: Points to the BEGINNING of the Heap, default = end of memory (max).

gp - Global Pointer: Used for global variables, default = end of memory (max) +1.

Currently working on Project 1; "Implement VPL by starting from the given file VPL.java. . .".

If you do anything make sure to add your name to the comment at the top of VPL.java
To launch from terminal, use "java VPL tests/exercise1b 50", you will be asked to input a number,
the program should output a '2' if the input is even and a '1' if the input is odd.
